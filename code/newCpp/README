usage: ./tspSolver [datafile]  [-o]

Use tspSolver to find an approximately optimized solution to a given TSP
instance.

positional arguments:
  datafile    A path to the file containing the input data. Will default to
              tsp_example_1.txt if not provided.

optional arguments:
  -o  Get a more optimized solution, at the cost of time.

tspSolver assumes many things:
    - An empty line signifies the end of data.
    - Each line contains three numbers seperated by a space.  The first number on each line is a city identifier (like a name).  The second number is the city's x-coordinate and the third number is the city's y-coordinate.
